# exploring problems of the pendulum
summarize our exploration of interesting problems and simpler variants that we can use to orient our understanding

## questions to answer
* how do we calculate the center of mass for a complicated object?
  * how do we approach this if the object isn't rigid?
* can we predict the dynamics of the driven rigid pendulum?
  * is there a closed-form solution?
* how do things change when the pendulum motion affects the driver's motion?
